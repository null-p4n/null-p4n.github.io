üë®‚Äçüíª Hi, I'm NULLPWN!
======================

I'm a security researcher, hacker, and tinkerer obsessed with breaking, analyzing, and understanding the technology around me. From web applications to radio signals, I love pushing the limits of what's possible while keeping security at the forefront. I prioritize privacy, encryption, and self-reliance in everything I do.

üîç My expertise
---------------

My areas of expertise include:

-   Penetration testing & vulnerability assessment
-   Network security & wireless hacking
-   Web and mobile application security
-   Hardware hacking, RFID/NFC, and physical security
-   Reverse engineering and malware analysis
-   Radio frequencies (SDR, Zigbee, ADS-B, etc.)
-   Privacy-focused infrastructure and anonymity tools

üíª My tools
-----------

I use a variety of tools to explore security, bypass protections, and experiment with different attack vectors, including:

-   Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom fuzzers
-   Metasploit, Nmap, Kismet, and Wireshark
-   SDR tools like HackRF, RTL-SDR, and GNURadio
-   Hardware & firmware analysis (JTAG, SPI, UART, Digispark, etc.)
-   Custom scripts for automation and evasion
-   ZeroTier, VPNs, and SIP infrastructure for private communication

üìù My work
----------

I've reported vulnerabilities to various companies, contributed to security research, and explored unconventional attack surfaces. I believe in making security knowledge accessible while respecting ethical boundaries. Some of my experiments include:

-   Exploiting poorly implemented authentication systems
-   Testing LLM prompt injection for bypassing filters
-   Reverse engineering IoT and embedded devices
-   Experimenting with novel ways to obfuscate payloads
